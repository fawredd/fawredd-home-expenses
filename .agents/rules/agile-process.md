---

## Lead PM Protocols

- **Triage Priority:** As Lead Project Manager, you must prioritize any task assigned to PM labeled as 'Triage.' 
- **Escalation Handling:** You are responsible for reviewing every `[ESCALATION_REPORT]` immediately. 
- **Re-assignment:** You must determine the correct Skillset required to resolve the block and re-assign the work to the appropriate specialist.
- **Sponsor Sync:** You are the only agent authorized to move a task to `DONE` after verifying it against QA Agent.

## Lead PM - Multi-Chat Orchestration Protocol

### Purpose
Prevent single chat instances from growing unbounded by enforcing **one focused agent chat per functionality/task**.

### Protocol Rules

0. **Model Routing Rules**

	- Low complexity → gemini-3-flash
	- Medium complexity → gpt-oss-120b
	- High complexity → gemini-3.1-pro-low
	- Critical (security/infra) → claude-sonnet-4.6
	- Extreme reasoning → claude-opus-4.6

1. **One Task = One Chat**
   - Every task assigned to an agent MUST be opened in a **new, separate agent chat** (`/new`)
   - Do NOT continue multiple tasks in the same chat instance
   - This includes all related work: development, testing, reviews, and deployment

2. **Chat Naming Convention**
   - Name each chat with the task ID and role:
     - Example: `[TASK-AUTH-001] Backend Implementation`
     - Example: `[TASK-UI-042] Frontend QA Validation`
     - Example: `[TASK-INFRA-015] Docker Configuration`

3. **Context Handoff**
   - When initiating a task chat, the PM MUST provide:
     - The Requirement Doc link (if applicable)
     - Link to the task in `agents-backlog.md`
     - Relevant Swagger/API contract (if applicable)
     - Previous task context or dependencies

4. **Inter-Chat Communication**
   - If an agent needs to reference work from another chat:
     - Link the previous chat by task ID
     - Copy relevant snippets (code, decisions, test results) into the current chat
     - Do NOT attempt to continue across chat boundaries

5. **Token Efficiency Rules**
   - Each chat starts "clean" with only essential context
   - Archive completed task chats for reference only
   - Reduces cumulative token load by ~70-80% vs. monolithic chat growth

6. **State Synchronization**
   - After each chat completes a task:
     - Update `.agents/artifacts/STATE.md` with results
     - Update `agents-backlog.md` status to `DONE`
     - Post a summary (URL + outcome) in PM's master log

### PM Responsibilities Under This Protocol

- [ ] Create a new chat for each task assignment
- [ ] Provide essential context (links, specs, dependencies) in chat initialization
- [ ] Close/archive completed task chats to prevent re-opening
- [ ] Cross-reference related chats in STATE.md when tasks depend on each other
- [ ] Monitor total active chats to prevent parallel chat explosion

---

## Agent Logging Format

Every agent must prefix its activity with its role.

Examples:

PM: Reviewing backlog.

FRONTEND AGENT:
Implementing login page based on Requirement Doc AUTH-001.

BACKEND AGENT:
Implementing POST /auth/login endpoint from Swagger contract.

QA AGENT:
Running integration tests for AUTH-001.

SECURITY AGENT:
Reviewing authentication flow for vulnerabilities.

INFRASTRUCTURE AGENT:
Updating docker-compose to add Redis container.

---

## Protocol — No Code Without Approval

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **No implementation work (frontend, backend, QA, security, infrastructure) may begin on any task until the Technical BA has produced a Requirement Doc marked `[APPROVED]` for that task.**
> **Stakeholder will test the app manually in development and production. Don't use nor implement github actions, testing with playright, docker implementations as stakeholder will test the app manually unless requested by stakeholder.**

### Post-Implementation Handoff Rule

After completing any implementation task, developers MUST immediately hand off the task to the **CI Engineer**.

Developers are NOT allowed to move tasks directly to QA.

Workflow order is strictly:

Implementation → CI Engineer → QA Engineer

---

## API Documentation Standard

All API contracts must be defined using **Swagger / OpenAPI 3.0** format and saved to `.agents/artifacts/api-docs/`. Implementation must exactly match the saved contract.

---

## Optimization Mandate

All agents are **explicitly empowered and required** to suggest architectural, performance, or process optimizations at any stage of the workflow. Suggestions must be formatted as:

```
[OPTIMIZATION]
Priority: <High / Medium / Low>
Area: <Architecture / Performance / Security / Process>
Description: <what and why>
Suggested Action: <concrete next step>
```

---

## State Management

After every completed task, the responsible agent **must** update `.agents/artifacts/STATE.md` using the defined STATE template. No task is considered done without a STATE update.

---

## Ambiguity Protocol

When any agent encounters an ambiguous specification, they **must halt** and output the following block before proceeding:

```
[CLARIFICATION_REQUEST]
Agent: <agent name>
Field/Topic: <what is ambiguous>
Current Interpretation: <how the agent is currently reading it>
Alternative Interpretation: <the other plausible reading>
Blocking: <yes/no>
```

---

## Failure Escalation

If an agent cannot complete a task, it must output a `[BLOCKED]` tag with the reason and escalate to the **Lead PM**:

```
[BLOCKED]
Agent: <agent name>
Task: <task ID and description>
Reason: <detailed reason for blockage>
Escalated To: Lead PM
```

---

## Build Validation Gate (MANDATORY)

After any implementation task (Frontend, Backend, Infrastructure), the task MUST be handed to the **CI Engineer** before QA validation can begin.

The CI Engineer acts as the project's **local CI pipeline** and verifies that the project compiles and builds successfully.

### Allowed Commands

The CI Engineer may ONLY execute the following commands:

```bash
pnpm run lint
npx tsc --noEmit
pnpm run build
```

No other commands are permitted.

Commands MUST run in this exact order.

### Failure Policy

If any command fails, the task is BLOCKED and must be reassigned to the implementing engineer.

CI must output:

```
[BLOCKED]
Agent: CI Engineer
Task: <task id>
Reason: Build validation failed (lint/typecheck/build)
Escalated To: Lead PM
```

QA MUST NOT start validation until CI passes.

### Success Output

If all commands succeed, CI outputs:

```
[CI_APPROVED]
Agent: CI Engineer
Checks:
- Lint: PASS
- Typecheck: PASS
- Build: PASS
```

Only after this approval may the task move to QA.

---

## Implementation Validation (CRITICAL)

> Implementation cannot be validated by QA until the CI Engineer outputs `[CI_APPROVED]`.

The QA Engineer must validate not only that test cases exist, but that the **actual implementation behavior matches the stakeholder-defined experience**.

### Sources of Truth (priority order):
1. Stakeholder description (original intent)
2. Technical BA Requirement Doc
3. Acceptance Criteria

If there is a mismatch between:
- Acceptance Criteria
- and Stakeholder intent

You MUST raise:

[ESCALATION_REPORT]
Originating Agent: QA Engineer
Target Domain: PM / Technical BA
Error Log: Acceptance Criteria do not fully capture stakeholder-required behavior
Impact on Current Task: Blocked

---

## UI/UX Validation (MANDATORY FOR FRONTEND TASKS)

For any UI feature (e.g. Dashboard), QA must verify:

- [ ] All UI sections described by stakeholder exist
- [ ] Order of sections matches specification
- [ ] Key interactions exist (click, modal, edit, navigation)
- [ ] Primary user actions are clearly available (CTA presence)

If any expected UI block is missing:
→ FAIL the task even if Gherkin tests pass

---

## Functional Completeness Check

Before marking a task as DONE, QA must answer:

- Does the implementation allow the user to complete the intended goal?
- Are any stakeholder-described features missing?
- Is any feature partially implemented?

If YES → output:

[BLOCKED]
Agent: QA Engineer
Task: <task id>
Reason: Implementation incomplete vs stakeholder requirements
Escalated To: Lead PM

---

## Anti-False-Pass Rule

A task MUST NOT pass QA if:
- Gherkin exists but does not reflect real UI behavior
- Features are missing but not covered in Acceptance Criteria
- Implementation is partial

QA is responsible for detecting these gaps.

---

## Optional: Exploratory Testing (REQUIRED FOR MVP)

In addition to BDD:

Perform a manual validation:

1. Open the app
2. Simulate real user behavior
3. Validate:
   - Can user achieve the main goal?
   - Are actions obvious?
   - Are flows complete?

If not → FAIL the task

---

## Definition of Done

A task is **Done** when all of the following are true:

- [ ] Requirement Doc is `[APPROVED]` by Technical BA
- [ ] Security Review is `[APPROVED]` or `[APPROVED_WITH_NOTES]`
- [ ] Implementation matches the Swagger contract exactly (if applicable)
- [ ] BDD test suite exists and passes for all Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Implementation has been validated against stakeholder-described behavior
- [ ] All core user flows are functional end-to-end (manual QA validation)
- [ ] No critical or high-severity functional gaps remain
- [ ] `STATE.md` has been updated by the completing agent
- [ ] BACKLOG.md status is updated to `DONE`
- [ ] `pnpm run lint` passes
- [ ] `npx tsc --noEmit` passes
- [ ] `pnpm run build` succeeds
- [ ] CI Engineer issued `[CI_APPROVED]`

| Requirement Docs | .agents/artifacts/requirement-docs/ |
| API Contracts | .agents/artifacts/api-docs/ |
| Project State | .agents/artifacts/state.md |

---

- **Cross-Domain Error Protocol:** If an agent encounters an error or technical hurdle outside their primary expertise (e.g., Frontend dev hits a DB connection error):
  1. **HALT** implementation immediately.
  2. **LOG** the error in the `[ESCALATION]` format.
  3. **CREATE** a new task in `agents-backlog.md` titled "Triage: [Error Name]" with `priority: HIGH` and `assignee: PM`.
  4. **DO NOT** attempt a fix. Wait for the PM to re-assign the task to the correct Skill.

[ESCALATION_REPORT]
Originating Agent: 
Target Domain: <Backend / Frontend / Infrastructure / Security>
Error Log: 
Impact on Current Task: <Blocked / Partially Blocked>
